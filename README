Title: Example code for the GTH API
Author: Matthias (matthias@corelatus.com)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A Corelatus GTH is a standalone piece of hardware which connects to
the telephone network through the E1/T1 interface. People build voicemail
systems, billing systems and network monitoring systems on top of GTHs.

This code is only really of interest to people using GTHs to build something.

The examples are broken up by language, and each language is
independent of the rest, i.e. the C examples don't use any code
from the Perl examples. The quality varies:

  erlang: A full parser for responses from the GTH
          A feature-complete Erlang API
          Both the parser and API are in fairly widespread use.

  Perl: A partial Perl API for the GTH.
        Good enough to get you started, but it doesn't support
           all of the GTH's features.
        We're not Perl experts, so the Perl may be a bit odd in places.

  Python: Good enough to get you started, but we're not Python experts
