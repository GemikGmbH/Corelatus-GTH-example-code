Title: README file for Erlang GTH example code
Author: matthias@corelatus.se
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is example code in Erlang for a Corelatus GTH. It is available under
a BSD licence. It includes:

  A complete parser for the XML a GTH emits. (see gth_client_xml_parse.erl)

  A complete native Erlang API for all GTH features. (see gth.erl)

  Three examples which use the Erlang API.

This code is used on the GTH itself, so it's in live use in dozens of
installations around the world. Several customers also use it in their
live systems.

Getting started
---------------

  erl -make

  Then either read gth.erl or look at the ss7_sniffer.erl example.

save_to_pcap.erl Example
------------------------

  Captures signalling from one of the GTHs E1 ports, in either
  MTP-2, frame relay or ATM AAL5 mode, and saves the signalling
  to a file in libpcap format, suitable for viewing with wireshark.

ss7_sniffer.erl Example
-----------------------

  Listens to an SS7-MTP2 link and decodes enough ISUP to show when
  calls start and stop.

record_and_play_back.erl Example
--------------------------------

  Save a bit-exact copy of a timeslot to a file, play back the
  contents of a file to a timeslot.
