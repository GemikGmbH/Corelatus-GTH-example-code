Title: Example code for the GTH API
Author: Matthias (matthias@corelatus.com)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A Corelatus GTH is a standalone piece of hardware which connects to
the telephone network through the E1/T1 interface. People build voicemail
systems, billing systems and network monitoring systems on top of GTHs.

This code is only really of interest to people using GTHs to build something.

The examples are broken up by language, and each language is
independent of the rest, i.e. you the C examples don't use any code
from the Perl examples.
