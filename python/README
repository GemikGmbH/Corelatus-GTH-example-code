This is example code in Python for a Corelatus GTH. The examples were
tested on python 2.5.4 on linux.

Keep in mind that I'm a python beginner, i.e. if it looks weird, then
that's most likely because I didn't know better. Suggestions for
improvement are welcome to matthias@corelatus.se

There are three examples:

Recorded file playback
----------------------

  Plays back a previously recorded timeslot on an E1. The GTH
  can record bit-exact copies of timeslots and then play back
  such files at a later time. Typical use:

    >./play.py 172.16.2.7 1A 16 signalling.raw
    All done, sent 2276 octets

  The file could contain audio (8kHz Alaw, without a header) or
  it could contain signalling. The GTH treats both the same. Most
  likely it's a dump of an E1 you recorded earlier using the next
  example.

E1 timeslot dump to a file
--------------------------

  This is the opposite of the first example, it copies the
  data on the given E1 to a file on your PC. Typical use:

    >./record.py 172.16.2.7 1A 16 4000 signalling.raw
    All done, wrote 4000 octets

Enable Layer 1 on an E1/T1 interface
------------------------------------

  At boot time, the E1/T1 interfaces on a GTH are all disabled, so
  you can't do anything useful with the above two examples until
  you turn on at least one E1/T1:

    >./enable_l1.py 172.16.2.7 3A

Sniff ISUP
----------

  Print out when calls start and stop on an SS7 link.

  Uses the GTH to decode MTP-1 and MTP-2. MTP-3 and ISUP decoding
  is done in python. Typical use:

     >./sniff_isup.py gth21 1A 16
     IAM called party: 21255512 calling party: 11313555 CIC=0
     ignoring ISUP address complete
     ignoring ISUP answer
     ignoring ISUP release
     RLC on CIC=0

The examples are built on top of a little library, gth/apilib.py,
which lets you hack up python code to do pretty much anything
supported by the GTH, i.e. you don't have to write your own parser.
