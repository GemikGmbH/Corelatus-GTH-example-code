Title: Example code for the GTH API
Author: Matthias (matthias@corelatus.com)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

A Corelatus GTH is a standalone piece of hardware which connects to
the telephone network through the E1/T1 interface. People build voicemail
systems, billing systems and network monitoring systems on top of GTHs.

This code is only really of interest to people using GTHs to build something.

The examples are broken up by language, and each language is
independent of the rest, i.e. the C examples don't use any code
from the Perl examples. The quality varies:

  erlang: A full parser for responses from the GTH
          A feature-complete Erlang API
          Both the parser and API are in fairly widespread use.

  Perl: A partial Perl API for the GTH.
        Good enough to get you started, but doesn't support GTH features.
        We're not Perl experts, so the Perl may be a bit odd in places.
        Some customers use this code for ad-hoc O&M.

  Python: A partial Python API for the GTH.
          Good enough to get you started, but doesn't support all GTH features.
          We're not Python experts.
          We're not aware of any customers using this code.

  C: A complete parser for GTH responses
     Several examples to get you started.
     Support for compiling on either *nix systems or win32.
     Some customers use this code for ad-hoc O&M.
